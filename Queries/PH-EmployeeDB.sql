---Determine Retirement Eligibility
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31';


---Employees Born in 1952
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1952-12-31';


---Narrow the Search for Retirement Eligibility
-- Retirement eligibility
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31';


---We're looking for employees born between 1952 and 1955, 
---who were also hired between 1985 and 1988
-- Retirement eligibility
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE (birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31')
AND (hire_date BETWEEN '1985-01-01' AND '1988-12-31');


---Count the Queries
-- Number of employees retiring
SELECT COUNT(first_name)
FROM employees
WHERE (birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31')
AND (hire_date BETWEEN '1985-01-01' AND '1988-12-31');


---Create New Tables

AND (hire_date BETWEEN '1985-01-01' AND '1988-12-31');

---This time, the change we'll make to the code is also 
---smallâ€”we're modifying the SELECT statement into a 
---SELECT INTO statement. This statement tells Postgres 
---that instead of generating a list of results, the data 
---is saved as a new table completely.
SELECT first_name, last_name

---Check Query for Confirmation
SELECT * FROM retirement_info;



---Export Data
---Then, follow these steps:
---1. Keep the Import/Export button toggled to "Export
---2. Click on the ... in the Filename field to automatically select the same directory from which you imported the other CSVs. Select a directory, but be sure to rename it to retirement_info.csv
---3. Be sure the format is still CSV.
---4. Toggle the Header section to "Yes" to include column names in the new CSV files.
---5. Select the comma as the delimiter to maintain the same format with all CSV files.


---Recreate the retirement_info Table with the emp_no Column
-- Create new table for retiring employees
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
INTO retirement_info
FROM employees
WHERE (birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31')
AND (hire_date BETWEEN '1985-01-01' AND '1988-12-31');
-- Check the table

---Use Inner Join for Departments and dept-manager Tables
-- Joining departments and dept_manager tables

     dept_manager.from_date,
     dept_manager.to_date
FROM departments
INNER JOIN dept_manager
ON departments.dept_no = dept_manager.dept_no;



---Use Left Join to Capture retirement-info Table
-- Joining retirement_info and dept_emp tables
SELECT retirement_info.emp_no,
    retirement_info.first_name,
	retirement_info.last_name,
    dept_emp.to_date
FROM retirement_info
LEFT JOIN dept_emp
ON retirement_info.emp_no = dept_emp.emp_no;


---Use Aliases for Code Readability

SELECT ri.emp_no,
    ri.first_name,
ri.last_name,
    de.to_date
FROM retirement_info as ri
LEFT JOIN dept_emp as de
ON ri.emp_no = de.emp_no;


--Update our other join.

INNER JOIN dept_manager

--Rename Department Using Alias
SELECT d.dept_name,
     dm.emp_no,
     dm.from_date,
     dm.to_date
FROM departments as d
INNER JOIN dept_manager as dm

--Use Left Join for retirement_info and dept_emp tables

de.to_date
INTO current_emp
FROM retirement_info as ri
LEFT JOIN dept_emp as de
ON ri.emp_no = de.emp_no
WHERE de.to_date = ('9999-01-01');

--Use Count, Group By, and Order By
-- Employee count by department number
SELECT COUNT(ce.emp_no), de.dept_no
FROM current_emp as ce
LEFT JOIN dept_emp as de
ON ce.emp_no = de.emp_no
GROUP BY de.dept_no;

FROM current_emp as ce
LEFT JOIN dept_emp as de
ON ce.emp_no = de.emp_no
GROUP BY de.dept_no

---Create Additional Lists
SELECT * FROM salaries;

---Order by Dates
SELECT * FROM salaries
ORDER BY to_date DESC;
